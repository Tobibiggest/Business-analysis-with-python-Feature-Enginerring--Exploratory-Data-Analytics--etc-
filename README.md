# Business analysis with python(Feature Enginerring, Exploratory Data Analytics, etc)
 Embarking on a captivating exploration within the hospitality realm, my data analytics voyage centered around unraveling the intricacies of an esteemed hotel group. Through meticulous data interaction, I cultivated a narrative of insight, beginning with the crucial phase of data cleaning to ensure a pristine foundation for analysis. Leveraging the power of feature engineering, I sculpted variables that would illuminate patterns and trends hidden within the dataset.  With an inquisitive spirit, I delved into exploratory data analysis (EDA), unraveling correlations, distributions, and anomalies that unveiled the story woven within the data's fabric. Each visualization and statistical examination served as a compass, guiding me toward actionable insights.  Ultimately, armed with a comprehensive understanding of the data, I extracted actionable insights poised to drive strategic decision-making. Through this voyage, the hotel group's data transformed from raw numbers into a beacon of knowledge, illuminating pathways for enhancement and growth.
